 * Module scripts (type="module") are deferred by default, so this code

 *
 * What this file does:
 *   1. Picks a random HAP pose and shows the image + caption.
 *   2. Fetches a roast from /.netlify/functions/insult and shows it.
 *   3. Wires up the "Generate a new roast" button to repeat both.
